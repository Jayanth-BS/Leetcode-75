// Question:
// A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.
// Given a tree of n nodes labelled from 0 to n - 1, and an array of n - 1 edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates 
// that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes ai and bi in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. 
// When you select a node x as the root, the result tree has height h. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. min(h))  are called minimum height trees (MHTs).

// Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any order.
// The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

// Solution:
